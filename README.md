# JoWinatha's Data Portfolio

## About Me
I am a data engineering with more than 5 years of experience specializing in building robust ETL pipelines for diverse data types and sources, including image processing and PI Sensor data streams. My expertise lies in designing and implementing scalable solutions that extract, transform, and load (ETL) large volumes of structured and unstructured data, ensuring high data quality and accessibility.

With hands-on experience in integrating multiple data sources into enterprise-grade data lakes, I leverage Dremio for high-performance analytics and MinIO for scalable, secure object storage. My work enables organizations to seamlessly unify and analyze data from disparate sources, empowering advanced analytics and informed decision-making.

Key skills include:

Developing ETL workflows for image data processing and PI Sensor data ingestion
Building and optimizing data pipelines to support real-time and batch data flows
Integrating heterogeneous data sources into centralized data lakes using Dremio and MinIO
Ensuring data reliability, scalability, and security in cloud and on-premise environments
I am passionate about leveraging modern data architectures to solve complex problems and deliver actionable insights for business growth.
